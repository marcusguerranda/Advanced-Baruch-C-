# Advanced-Baruch-C-

This is the second course for the Baruch College Ms. Financial Engineering program (one of the top-ranked program in the U.S).

Taught by Prof. Duffy and Avi Palley (quant strat on Wall Street); what I like most about this course is that I am learning best-practices used in finance as well as some of the more advanced features of C++.

Here is the syllabus for the course, if anyone is interested: https://quantnet.com/doc/Advanced_C++_and_Modern_Design.pdf 

I personally found the course quite intellectually stimulating, and the feedback provided by Avi helps correcting mistakes and improving programming.
